# Exercises

1. Import human hg19 gene coordiantes from "hg19Genes.txt and create a GRanges of Transcription start sites (1 bp range).
    + Tip: How to identify TSS for genes in forward/reverse strand?
2. Create a GRanges object of human promoters with TSS ± 2000bp.
    + Tip: Read the documentation for `promoters` function.
3. Import ELF1 binding sites in K562 cell from Encode (ELF1_K562.bed) and create GRanges object. 
    + Tips: Import the ELF1 binding sites using `import.bed()` function from `rtracklayer` package
    + Find ELF1 binding sites overlap with promoters (TSS ± 1kb) using `findOverlaps` and `subsetByOverlaps` (Remember BED format uses 0-based coordinates)
