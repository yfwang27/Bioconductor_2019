# Exercises

* Download the following BAM and index files (.bai) (ENCODE data - ChIP-Seq of CTCF in Ag04449 human fibroblast cells).
  + http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwTfbs/wgEncodeUwTfbsAg04449CtcfStdAlnRep1.bam
  + http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwTfbs/wgEncodeUwTfbsAg04449CtcfStdAlnRep1.bam.bai
* Use `readGAlignments` to read the bam. Construct an `ScanBamParam` object that accepts only aligned reads, passing quality control and not duplicates.
* Compute genome wide coverage using `coverage` function
* Export coverage as bigWig using `export.bw()` from rtracklayer package and visualise it using IGV
* Compute number of reads overlapping with hg19 promoters (TSS Â± 1kb) and export the results as text file.
